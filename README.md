Initial Commit of Books Read (Alphabetical by Author for 2015)

I initially started because I would end up ordering a book I had previously read. So I started to keep notes of books read. Then I had the bright idea of writing a book report for each book (which would help to more 'digest' the contents.) Both of these ideas however, (Keeping notes, writing book reports)
ended up cutting into my reading time. (Sacrilege!) So they went by the wayside. I had got in the habit of recording books read though, and so I continue to do that. This current incarnation of this list began early 2015, thru the present.
This list has gone through some style changes, depnding on whatever I software I use to record the titles. 

# While I shudder at curating this list (making reports, notes, etc) If anyone has any interest in any of the following titles, hit me up, and I'll be glad to give my opinion of them.

# LOST Reading list

I came across a previous reading list I was compiling, and will add it here in the end.
